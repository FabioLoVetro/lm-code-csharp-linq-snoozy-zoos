# 😴🦁 Snoozy Zoos - LINQ Queries Practice

😱 Oh no! The Zookeepers at Snoozy Zoos are in a bit of a pickle (mmm…pickles!).

The Zoo Animals 🦁 🐸 🐼🐯🦥 analysis software has gone awry! Your challenge is to help the Zookeepers analyse the data using your LINQ queries skills.

Please work through each challenge one-by-one to help the Zookeepers restore order to Snoozy Zoos.

---

## How do I solve the challenges?

- You will find 4 challenges in the [Program.cs](./SnoozyZoos/Program.cs) file.

- You can find the models for the Zoo Animals in the following [directory](./SnoozyZoos/Models/).

- For each challenge, your goal is to match the expected output.

- To solve each challenge, uncomment the code and write your LINQ queries. For example, in Challenge 1, you can uncomment the following code to write your LINQ queries.

```csharp
/*
var challengeOneZooAnimals = // Write your LINQ Query here

foreach (var zooAnimal in challengeOneZooAnimals)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{zooAnimal.Name}, {zooAnimal.Age}");
}
*/
```
🦁 Good luck and thank you for helping Snoozy Zoos!
